		<p>
			The call for sustainable and affordable housing is clearâ€”people across the globe are
			witnessing a shortage of homes. Moreover, the dialogue around construction has shifted to
			consider sustainable design. Can we diminish our ecological footprint while addressing a need
			for housing? When we build with concrete, wood, and other conventional materials, we
			contribute to a myriad of harmful environmental impacts: carbon emissions, disproportionate
			water usage, urban heat islands, deforestation, and more. Bamboo presents itself as a unique
			alternative with its rapid growth cycles, carbon-sequestering abilities, and mechanical
			strength. How is bamboo currently being used in the built environment, and how can it flourish
			in the future?
