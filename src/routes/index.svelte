	<p>
		The call for sustainable and affordable housing is clearâ€”people across the globe are witnessing
		a shortage of homes. Moreover, the dialogue around construction has shifted to consider
		sustainable design. Can we diminish our ecological footprint while addressing a need for
		housing? When we build with concrete, wood, and other conventional materials, we contribute to a
		myriad of harmful environmental impacts: carbon emissions, disproportionate water usage, urban
		heat islands, deforestation, and more. Bamboo presents itself as a unique alternative with its
		rapid growth cycles, carbon-sequestering abilities, and mechanical strength. How is bamboo
		currently being used in the built environment, and how can it flourish in the future?
