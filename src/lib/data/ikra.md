#### Example of a traditional Assam-type house [1].

**Assam-type houses** (also called Ikra houses) can be seen as a more "evolved" version of Chang Ghar houses, combining both traditional and modern building techniques [1]. They generally have:

- **one story** (and very occasionnally two stories)
- a **rectangular shape** for single-family homes and an **L or C shape** for multi-family homes
- a **kitchen** and **bathroom** behind the main rooms
- **open space** in the front yard and behind the main rooms

#### Plan variations of a typical Assam-type house [1].

Assam-type houses are similar to a vernacular **laminated bamboo frame** house, where bamboo or posts are driven into the ground, without any formal foundation. The walls are built on top of this frame, using **bamboo matting** and **Ikra reed** infill. **Mud and cow dung** are applied to both sides of the wall for added durability.

Similar to Chang Ghar houses, Assam-type houses have steep-sloped roofing, made of wooden trusses and a layer of Ikra reed.

## Modern variations on the Assam-type house

Newer Assam-type houses often feature material changes, some of which improve durability [1]:

- **a formal foundation** using plinth, burnt-brick, and reinforced concrete footings
- walls made of **chicken wire mesh** and **brick masonry**, instead of Ikra reed and mud plaster
- roofs made of **galvanized iron (GI)** sheets

However, this modernization is also a tradeoff with the sustainability of Assam-type house construction materials.
