## Designing and Building with Bamboo

Janssen's manual on _Designing and Building with Bamboo_ makes a strong case for the importance of **well-designed joints** in bamboo construction [1]. Janssen's classification groups serve as a framework to explain how forces can be distributed in different engineered joints.

Janssen outlines the following **guiding principles** for joint classification [1]:

1. A joint between two whole bamboo culms can be made either by contact between the full cross-sections, or by collecting forces from the cross-section to a joining element.
2. Collecting the forces may occur from the inside, from the cross-section or from the outside.
3. The joining element can run parallel with the fibers or perpendicular to them.

He then uses these guiding principles to outline **eight joint classification groups** [1]:

- **Group 1:** full cross-section
- **Group 2:** from inside to an element parallel
- (**Group 3:** from inside to an element perpendicular)
- **Group 4:** from cross-section to element parallel
- **Group 5:** from cross-section to element perpendicular
- **Group 6:** from outside to element parallel
- (**Group 7:** from outside to element perpendicular)
- **Group 8:** for split bamboo

Groups 3 and 7 have theoretical significance but little practical application. Moreover, based on the specific caveats of each joint, implementations of Janssen's joint groups can often overlap.

## Group 1

Joints in Group 1 involve contact of the bamboo culm's full cross-section.

## Group 2

Joints in Group 2 collect the force from the inside of the bamboo culm and transmit it to an element parallel, such as cement mortar or a piece of timber.

## Group 4

Joints in Group 4 collect the force from the cross-section of the bamboo culm and transmit it to an element parallel, such as pins of steel or wood.

## Group 5

Joints in Group 5 involve pins and bolts that are inserted into the cross-section of the culm, in a perpendicular direction.

## Group 6

Joints in Group 6 have a material attached to the outside of the culm (traditionally lashings, now steel wire and clamps), which is then connected to a parallel element.

## Group 8

Joints in Group 8 are specific to split bamboo, using materials such as glue, nails, or galvanized steel.
