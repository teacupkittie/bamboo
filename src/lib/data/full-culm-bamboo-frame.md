name: Full culm bamboo frame
---

**Full culm bamboo frame houses** are exactly what they sound like. Instead of wood planks or laminated bamboo planks, they use full culm bamboo to create the frame of the structure. This is distinct from [cement bamboo frame construction](#cement-bamboo-frame), which uses cement mortar to provide a walling system.

Examples of full culm bamboo frame construction range from **practical and afforable homes** to **extravagant architectural structures**. H&P Architects designed the modular [Blooming Bamboo (BB)](https://hpa.vn/en/project/to-am-no-hoa/) home, aiming to address Vietnam's need for affordable and weather-resistant housing [1]. They emphasize the BB home's potential for connecting to vernacular architecture, noting that users can build the house by themselves and incorporate local materials.

[CRU! architects](https://www.cru-architecten.be/) have worked on many bamboo design projects, including a full culm bamboo frame community center for the low-income community of Camburi in Brazil.

[Ibuku](https://ibuku.com/) is an architecture studio in Bali, Indonesia that specializes in **luxury bamboo structures** [4]. Ibuku's design process is deliberate and well-documented, from bamboo sourcing to treatment to modeling to construction. Their projects include:

- elevated private homes such as the [Sharma Springs Residence](https://ibuku.com/sharma-springs-residence/) [5]
- the [Pemulung Housing Project](https://ibuku.com/pemulung-housing/), a commissioned housing compound for garbage collectors in Bali [6]
- the [Mepantigan Auditorium](https://ibuku.com/mepantigan-auditorium/), built for the Green School [7]
- and more!
