name: Full culm bamboo construction
---

Building with **bamboo in its natural form**—culms or poles—is one of the most viable and sustainable ways to address the housing crisis in many developing countries [1]. In contrast with [engineered products](#engineered-products) such as laminated bamboo planks, the tradeoff is clear. While full culm bamboo construction **requires less processing and manufacturing** (which means a lesser carbon footprint), the culm is **a foreign building unit**. Most engineers don't quite know how to build with it. Bamboo is round-ish, it has nodes, and its geometry varies... between species, between culms, and even within the same culm.

## Research

In recent years, researchers have invested significant effort into understanding bamboo's physical and mechanical properties, so that they may be used in "formal design and fabrication processes" [1, 2]. One such example is **modelling hundreds of bamboo culms using CAD software** to better understand bamboo's complex shapes. With these strategies, bamboo poles can be used in digital modelling, parametric design, advanced simulations. and more.

## Standards

**Standards** are incredibly important in construction, detailing the best ways to build [4]. International standards **ISO 22156** and **ISO 22157** were first published in 2004, setting guidelines for building with bamboo culms [4, 5]. ISO 22156 was republished in 2021, detailing structural design with bamboo culms [4]. ISO 22157 was republished in 2019, determining physical and mechanical properties of bamboo culms [5].
