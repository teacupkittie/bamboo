name: Wattle and daub
---

**Wattle and daub** is considered one of the most popular vernacular bamboo construction methods, used widely across the globe. In Latin America, it's referred to as [bahareque](#bahareque) [1].

Wattle and daub has several key components [2]:

- a **frame** made from either timber or full culm bamboo
- a **wall matrix** made from split bamboo, woven twigs, opened bamboo, cane, or small-diameter bamboo [1]
  - steel mesh and barbed wire is sometimes fixed to the frame [1]
- a **wall render** made from manure or mud, sometimes with added straw or a limestone finish
- an **upstand** made from rock or brick to reduce rotting from dampness
- a **roof** historically made from palm fronds, later from clay tiles after the Spanish invasion, and now sometimes corrugated iron sheets [1]

Wattle and daub has been documented throughout **China**, specifically in dwellings of Han people and some minorities, including Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan provinces [3]. It's also the primary vernacular bamboo walling technique throughout **eastern Senegal**, **southern India**, and more [4, 5].
