**Bahay Kubo (a.k.a. nipa hut or "cubed house" in English)** dates back to the pre-colonial era, shaped by its environment and culture [2]. The climate in the Philippines is characterized by strong winds, monsoons, and high heat in various times of the year [3]. As a result, Bahay Kubo has:

- **high-pitched thatched roofs** with a wide overhang to protect the walls from water [2]
- **a raised foundation** to keep the house dry during floods
- **a floor of bamboo slats** to conduct air into the house
- **ceiling vents** and **permeable material** (such as bamboo mats) to allow heat to escape [3]

Bahay Kubo's cubed interior has **a single room**, housing anywhere from a married couple to an extended family [2]. The single room notably influences customs in the house: families do everything together, and in the same space. Space within the Bahay Kubo is **open and multifunctional**, with cooking and dining areas during the day and sleeping mats rolled out at night. The single-room structure also redefined privacy: in order to be "no longer present" within a space, one could simply look away and face the wall [2].

## Bahay Kubo-inspired designs

Designs for mass housing based on Bahay Kubo were developed in the 1990s, using indigenous materials such as bamboo for their **cost-efficiency** and **thermal qualities** [3]. In 2019, the company Cubo was founded, reimagining Bahay Kubo in the form of **contemporary prefabricated homes** [4]. Although Cubo homes have modernized construction practices, they still retain the characteristic cube shape.
