## Traditional treatment methods

Several traditional treatment methods exist, including:

- **soaking for several weeks in water** to rinse out excess starch
- **smoking** as heat treatment
- **painting** for water protection

However, these traditional methods have limited effect and are not suitable for long-term treatment [1].

## Preservatives

Preservatives are toxins that prevent fungal and insect attack [1]. **Boron** is regarded as the best chemical to use.

**Pros of boron:**

- cheap to use
- effective in its insecticidal and fungicidal properties
- low toxicity to mammals (including humans!)

**Cons of boron:**

- dissolves in water, so the bamboo can't get wet

Preliminary research has pointed to **modern copper-based preservatives** as an alternative to boron that does not leach out in water [1]. However, moderm copper-based preservatives have minimal practical application so far, specifically because they are notably more expensive.

## Preservative treatment methods

Several vetted preservative treatment methods are used frequently throughout bamboo construction, most commonly with boron [1].

1. **soaking** or **bath:** the bamboo is soaked in a preservative bath for 10 to 14 days

2. **vertical soak diffusion:** the preservative is poured vertically into bamboo culms
3. **modified boucherie:** the preservative is "pushed through the bamboo under pressure, replacing the sap"
4. **injection:** the preservative is injected into each culm through drilled holes in the internode [2]
