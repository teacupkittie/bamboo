**Vernacular architecture** draws upon local practices and materials that are geographically, historically, and culturally relevant to the area.

Some locations may be hotter, or wetter, or more predisposed to natural disasters. Sites with tropical climate have higher rainfall, solar radiation, temperature differences, and more [1]. As a result, the vernacular housing methods that develop over time are reflective of what is "well-suited to the culture and region in which they are situated" [2].
