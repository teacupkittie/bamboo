name: Vernacular construction

**Vernacular architecture** draws upon local practices and materials that are geographically, historically, and culturally relevant to the area. These traditional practices are "based on a long history of empirical experience," drawing techniques from decades of building [1].

Some locations may be hotter, or wetter, or more predisposed to natural disasters. Sites with tropical climate have higher rainfall, solar radiation, temperature differences, and more [2]. The vernacular housing methods that develop over time are reflective of what is "well-suited to the culture and region in which they are situated" [3].

In other words, how have places around the world built with bamboo over time?
