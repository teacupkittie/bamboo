#### Mising-tribe Chang Ghar house [1].

**Chang Ghar** is an "age-old tribal housing structure," most notably characterized by houses on stilts, either near the forest, river, or hills [1]. They generally have:

- **5-7 flights of stairs** to access the house
- a rectangular shape, with **rooms that open into each other**
- **boats underneath the house** in areas that flood easily

By raising the houses on stilts, Chang Ghar houses field against moisture and pests.

#### Basic plan of a Chang Ghar housing unit [1].

Chang Ghar's **primary structure** is built with bamboo posts and bamboo diagonal bracings. **Permeable bamboo flooring** is made with "split bamboo and finished with flattened bamboo" [1]. For **roofing**, high-pitched roofs are crucial to accommodate Assam's heavy rainfall. Roofs are generally constructed from wooden trusses and a thick layer of Ikra reed laid on top.
