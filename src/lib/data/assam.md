Two major types of houses are found in Assam: the more traditional **Chang Ghar house** and the relatively newer **Assam-type house** [1]. Although distinct, both housing structures leverage bamboo to support families in Assam's unique climate.

## Assam's climate

Assam commonly has **frequent, heavy rain showers** for many months of the year [1]. Assam also lies in the seismic zone V region, which means that local structures must be able to resist **massive earthquakes**, too.

## Vernacular highlights

**Bamboo** plays a central role in Assam's vernacular architecture because of its local abundance, lightweight properties, and thermal properties that shield against harsh weather [1]. Other materials include wood, cane, reed, thatch, mud, and coir. These natural materials contribute to the structures' **environmental sustainability**.

Frames used in Assam-type houses divide the wall into smaller sections, "**distributing lateral and shear forces** during an earthquake" [1]. Chang Ghar's coir and jute rope joints **add flexibilty** to the structure, leading to strong earthquake performance.
