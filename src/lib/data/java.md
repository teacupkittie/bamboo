Vernacular architecture in Java varies across the island in its building size and material usage. However, most houses follow two common forms: the **Joglo** and the **Limasan**, classified by their extended sheet roofs [1].

Most houses use either **brick masonry, wood, and/or bamboo**. On one hand, a brick house was a symbol of wealth and status [1]. On the other hand, families would choose wood or bamboo based on material availability. Of the provinces surveyed, **the inland region of Imogiri and the coastal region of Kulon Progo** primarily use woven bamboo walls.

Java's high temperatures drive the design of vernacular homes. _Joglo_ houses in Imogiri and Kulon Progo have **front openings to encourage air circulation**, albeit no windows [1]. From a technical perspective, it was hard for them to build windows into bamboo walls compared to brick walls.

Instead, they make the most of bamboo's permeability. **Homes are oriented toward the south** to let the southern wind breeze in [1]. Residents also take advantage of bamboo's earthquake protection, and use **permeable clay tiles** release the hot air from inside the house.
