**Cement-bamboo frame** technology (also known as **engineered bahareque**) introduces standardization and modern construction techniques to vernacular [bahareque](#bahareque) [1]. **ISO 22156:2021**, published by the International Organization on Standardization, is a modern standard that outlines processes for connection and element design for building with bamboo poles, specifically including **light cement bamboo frame (LCBF)** construction [2].

Improvements in safety and durability make engineered bahareque a suitable option for **low-cost housing design** [3].

## Structural features

Engineered bahareque has several key characteristics [3]:

- a **foundation** of reinforced concrete strip footings
- an **upstand** made from reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry
- a **primary wall structure** made from timber or bamboo columns with **modern mechanical connections** (i.e. bolts, nails, screws) and sometimes bracing
- a **wall matrix** made from cane, small diameter bamboo, bamboo laths, or bamboo mats
  - galvanized steel chicken mesh is fixed to the frame for reinforcement
- a **wall render** made from cement mortar, sometimes with lime added
- potential for an **upper floor** made from timber or bamboo beams
  - **flooring** made from plywood, bamboo mats with concrete poured on top, or timber floorboards
- a **roof** made from timber or bamboo rafters and purlins
  - a **roof covering** of metal sheeting, cement fiberboard sheeting, or clay tiles

## Case studies

The [Base Bahay Foundation](http://www.base-builds.com/our-houses/) uses cement-bamboo frame technology to build affordable housing in the Philippines, contributing to research and education along the way [4]. Their **accredited prefabricated frame system** uses bamboo for community housing projects in places such as [Iloilo City](http://www.base-builds.com/project/lanit-iloilo-city%e2%80%8b/), [Cabug](http://www.base-builds.com/project/gawad-kalinga-village-cabug/), and [Basey](http://www.base-builds.com/project/st-louis-de-marillac-village-basey%e2%80%8b/).

National bamboo housing initiatives have also been implemented across Latin America in **Costa Rica**, **Colombia**, and **Ecuador** [1].
