Bamboo varies in its geometry from culm to culm, so joints are naturally a crucial part of a full culm bamboo frame's sturdiness. **Joint design** dictates how the structure responds to compression, stress, shear, and more. Jointing practices should support the strength of the bamboo rather than contributing to its weakness.

## Vernacular construction joints

Through empirical building, certain joint types arise from the unique characteristics of bamboo that cannot be replicated by other materials, also known as **"original" connections** [1]. Common original bamboo connections include:

- **fish-mouth joints**, with a "fish mouth" saddle on one end and a long tongue-shaped strap bent over another culm on the other end
- **lashing joints**, where coir fiber, bast, rattan or bamboo rope is wrapped around the connecting bamboo culms
- **plug-in joints**
- **positive-fitting joints**

These original joints are often combined throughout vernacular structures to offer different types of support.

## Engineered construction joints

Engineered construction joints are modern iterations of vernacular joints that architects and engineers have developed [1]. Based on fundamental research and prototype testing, engineered joints generally have improved strength and constructability.

Most notably, **bolted joints** provide easy workability, high durability, and the potential for three-dimensional bamboo frames [1].

Researchers and engineers are also experimenting with other jointing methods, such as "**flexible joints** in polyester ropes and locking bio-composite bandage rings" [2].
