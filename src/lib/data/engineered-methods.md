**Engineered methods** in construction apply systematic strategies to buildingâ€”standards, models, simulations, and more [1]. Compared to [vernacular construction](#vernacular-construction), these engineered methods allow for precision, scability, and added safety [2].

For most conventional building materials such as steel and concrete, engineered methods are well-established and considered the default. However, **bamboo is still relatively new** to engineered construction. As a material with historic vernacular significance, bamboo's "empirical know-how" is often disregarded in modern architecture [1]. With standardized practices and a quantitative understanding of bamboo's properties, bamboo can be repositioned as **a viable "alternative structural element"** [1]. There are many ways to approach engineered bamboo methods, from [substitutive construction](#substitutive-construction) to [building with bamboo culms](#full-culm).
