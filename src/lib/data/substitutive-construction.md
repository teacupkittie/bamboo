One of the biggest barriers to building with bamboo is **a lack of standardization** in its geometry [1]. Bamboo culms are round and they vary in size, so modern construction practices haven't been able to use bamboo in the same way that they would use wood or metal.

Enter **engineered bamboo products**, which "create standard sections for members and connections" [1]. In this way, bamboo components can be **substituted** for conventional materials in popular construction methods.

Although full culm construction is more sustainable, the ease of use of engineered bamboo products drives large-scale adoption of bamboo as an alternative material [2]. Moreover, engineered bamboo products draw on the layman's associations with better quality and safety.
