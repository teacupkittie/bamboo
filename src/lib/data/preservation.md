## Attack!

**Preventing decay** is a primary concern when building with bamboo, especially because bamboo has fewer natural toxins than wood [1]. Moreover, since bamboo is hollow, a small amount of decay can mean a large proportion of lost mass. Three common causes of decay include **beetle attack**, **termite attack**, and **rotting** [1].

## Protection methods

With preventing decay, the goal is to **keep the bamboo dry** [1]. Recommended protection methods include using a roof with a good overhang and avoiding water traps. Moreover, separating bamboo from the ground with a concrete slab can prevent subterranean termite attack.

In colder, drier climates, these protection methods will generally be enough [1]. However, bamboo building in tropical climates often require **treatment methods**.
