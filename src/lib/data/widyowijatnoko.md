name: Widyowijatnoko's joint classification
---

Eleven years after Janssen published _Designing and Building with Bamboo_ with criteria for bamboo joint classification, Widyowijatnoko and Trautz proposed **an alternative system** that would eliminate redundancy and theoretical joint groups [1], [2].

Widyowijatnoko and Trautz's refined classification was developed upon an adjusted set of **guiding principles** [2]:

1. **Method of force transfer** (compression, tension, friction, shear, or stress)
2. **Position of the connector** (inside or outside; parallel or perpendicular)
3. A 'connection' is between one bamboo culm and its connector or supporting base, while a
   'joint' is a collection of connections.

Principle 3 fundamentally distinguishes Widyowijatnoko's classification from Janssen's classification, which defines a joint as a connection between two bamboo culms [2].

Their guiding principles give way to a new set of **six joint classification groups**:

- **Group 1:** transferring compression through contact with the whole section
- **Group 2:** transferring force through friction on the inner surface or compression to the diaphragm
- **Group 3:** transferring force through friction on the outer surface
- **Group 4:** transferring force through bearing stress and shear to the bamboo wall from perpendicular elements connected from the inside (4A) or outside (4B) of the culm
- **Group 5:** transferring force perpendicular to the fibers
- **Group 6:** transferring radial compression to the center of the culm through shear and circumferential stress perpendicular to the fibers

## Group 1

Connections in Group 1 transmit compression through contact to the whole cross-section of the bamboo culm.

## Group 2

Connections in Group 2 transfer force via the inner surface, often using a filling material (such as cement mortar or epoxy resin) with an embedded bolt or connector.

## Group 3

Connections in Group 3 transfer force via the outer surface. Lashing joints are a common application of Group 3 connections.

## Group 4

Connections in Group 4 are one of the most common modern connections, inserting a pin through the culm in a perpendicular direction.

## Group 5

Connections in Group 5 transfer force perpendicular to the culm, which are most reliably accomplished via fish mouth joints to maximize surface area contact.

## Group 6

Relatively similar to connections in Group 3, connections in Group 6 transfer radial compression to the center of the culm, improving internal friction and mitigating bamboo splitting. An example would be pretension of lashing joints.

## Combinations of connections

Widyowijatnoko and Harries also discuss **combinations of connections** to form joints that optimize different benefits of distributing force throughout the culm. There have been 17 combinations identified among connection groups 1 through 4, as well as specific combinations (i.e. Group 3 with Group 6, and Group 5 with Group 6). The fish mouth joint is a popular example of a combination of a Group 1 and Group 6 connection.
