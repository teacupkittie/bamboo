name: Mru house

As design approaches in architecture continue to evolve, many trends turn back to vernacular design's aesthetics and ergonomics [1]. Through design principles that developed incrementally over time, Mru houses have many modernist solutions that leverage and respond to their unique area in the **Chittagong Hill Tracts** [1].

**Mru houses** are characterized by their **three-dimensional stilt foundations**, propping up posts from three sides to "to counteract any lateral sliding in case of soil shifts or earthquakes." A pattern of **five pillars** in two rows is key, for several reasons [1]:

- **dividing the space** for organizing elements such as openings
- evenly **distributing the roof load**
- making it possible to use bamboo and smaller tree trunks

Mru houses also have [1]:

- a private bedroom area (the _kimma_) and an open multipurpose living room (the _kim-tom_)
- a **thick, triple-layered bamboo floor** that serves as a "a flat plate system that resists the upward shearing impact of columns"
- a part of the floor space that juts out in **a cantilever** over the steep slope side
  - **porous slat gridwork** that reduces structural load while allowing air to flow in and moderate humidity
- lashings and clippings for joints, which were regarded as safe and reliable
