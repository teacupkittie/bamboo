name: Laminated bamboo frame

**Laminated bamboo frame building** is a direct alternative to wood-frame building, where laminated bamboo is used instead of wooden beams [1].

Not only does it lower the environmental impact of the built environment, but bamboo also has a much higher annual yield per hectare compared to wood [1]. In other words, where we'd be able to build **one house every four years with wood**, we could build **one house every year with bamboo** [1]. For example, if Guadua bamboo forest area reached just 10% of its potential in Colombia, we could build 200,000 laminated bamboo frame houses each year.

This bamboo building method lends itself well to **prefabricated and modular homes**, made for quick assembly at a large scale. [Cubo](https://cubo.ph/) is one such example of a company that produces these prefabricated homes, accelerating sustainable building while providing affordable housing solutions in the Philippines.
