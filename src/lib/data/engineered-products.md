Engineered bamboo products such as **laminated bamboo** and **bamboo scrimber** are manufactured to be used in place of conventional materials [1].

## Laminated bamboo

While **laminated bamboo** utilizes the full culm at around 30% efficiency, it discards denser parts of the culm while maintaining similar tensile and compressive strength [1]. Here's how laminated bamboo is made:

1. bamboo culms are **split into strips** and planed
2. rectangular planes are **caramelized** and **boiled**
3. boiled planes are **stacked**, **glued**, and **pressed**

## Bamboo scrimber

**Bamboo scrimber** (a.k.a. strand-woven bamboo or parallel-strand bamboo) utilizes the full culm with 80% efficiency. The process is as follows [1]:

1. bamboo culms are **split into strips**
2. strips **preserved**, **caramelized**, and **dried**
3. dried strips are **crushed**, **coated in resin**, **pressed**, and **cured**
