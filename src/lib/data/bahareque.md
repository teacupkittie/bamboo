**Bahareque** _(bah-hah-RAY-kay)_ refers to a popular derivative of [wattle and daub](#wattle-and-daub), local to Latin America [1]. It's also known as "**'quincha'** in Peru, **'cuje'** in Cuba, **'pao pique'** in Brazil and **'tabiquería'** in other countries" [1].

## Latin America's climate

Natural disasters and poor political policies have left Latin Americans with **a severe housing deficit**, estimated in 2013 to be a shortage of at least 42 million homes [1]. Latin America is vulnerable to earthquakes, volcanoes, flooding, hurricanes, and high rainfall—ultimately **an aggressive climate and seismic region**.

## Durability

In seismic regions, **structural unity and flexibility** are key to the durability of the house. Bahareque houses that are properly constructed and maintained can be very durable, but variability in workmanship can introduce weaknesses.

In recent decades, **engineered bahareque** has emerged as an iteration on vernacular construction that reduces bahareque's natural deficiencies [2]. The section on [engineered bahareque](#cement-bamboo-frame) details the method's influence on several housing projects across Latin America [1].
