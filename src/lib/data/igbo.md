name: Igbo-style house
---

**The Igbo tribe** is found in the southeastern region of Nigeria, with houses built from mud, grass, bamboo, and raffia palms [1]. Vernacular architecture in the Igbo region prioritizes communality, so houses are often arranged in settlements with **a community space at the center** for public discussions and festivals. Igbo-style houses have several key qualities:

- they are either **rectangular or circular houses**
- they have **pitched thatch roofs and hip thatched roofs**
- they use **clay, grass, and bamboo** to keep cool in southern Nigeria's tropical hot-humid climate
