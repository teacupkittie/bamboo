name: Senegalese bamboo roof technique
---

Aside from [wattle-and-daub](#wattle-and-daub) walls that are sometimes used in eastern Senegal vernacular architecture, bamboo is primarily used throughout their **roofing techniques** [1]. Roofing methods can be categorized into three groups, each involving a bamboo frame covered with plant fibers, pitched directly onto the building walls.

For the **bamboo frame**, three or four bamboo stalks are lashed together with "a double-ring of braided plant fibres" [1]. Then, additional bamboo talks and rings of plant fiber are added as necessary to complete the frame.

## Roof covering methods

**Roof-covering method A** involves spreading straw evenly over the bamboo frame [1]. Then, the straw is fixed to the frame with a fiber cord and simple a bamboo scaffold. This roof covering is expected to last **1-5 years**.

**Roof-covering method B** involves weaving plant fibers or wires through the widest parts of the straw to create strips (2-4 centimeters thick) [1]. These strips are then rolled out on the roof frame, stacked together, and often fixed with additional bamboo stalks. Compared to method A, method B is more sturdy and expected to last **3-8 years**.

**Roof-covering method C** involves clamping layers of straw (10 centimeters thick) between cut stalks of bamboo and the original frame [1]. Roughly 12-15 layers of straw are stacked together in the final roof covering. Compared to the other methods, method C is the most sturdy and expected to last **7-20 years**.

## Distribution of construction techniques

Construction techniques, both in walling and roofing, vary geographically across eastern Senegal.

For walling:

- **Northern zone:** primarily brick walling
- **Northern half of the central zone:** primary wattle-and-daub walling
- **Southern half of the central zone:** primarily brick walling
- **Southern zone:** primary cob walling

For roofing:

- **Northern zone:** primarily method A
- **Central zone:** primarily method B
- **Southern zone:** primarily method A and method C

These techniques and their usage have also changed over time in the different ethnic groups [1]. Socio-economic factors have also played into these differences.
